##ft_printf
#Description

The ft_printf project is a reimplementation of the standard C library function printf. The goal of this project is to deepen the understanding of variadic functions, memory handling, and formatted output in C.

This custom implementation reproduces the behavior of printf for a defined set of format specifiers, while respecting strict coding standards and limitations imposed by the 42 curriculum.
